Gatehouse:
    The town road should have an exit point out of the map, but the player is
    confined within the town boundaries. This exit point is a gatehouse or a
    customs gate of some sort.

Possible home layout:
    https://davisframe.com/floor-plans/classic-colonial-1b/ would be 2x1 tiles

Train:
    It could be fun if the town has a train that runs into it.
    For ease of implementation, the train just takes a straight path.
    So it will just go either WEST <--> EAST or NORTH <--> SOUTH 

    So here is a blank map.
        0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
        0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
        0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
        0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
        0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

    The train would generate like this:
        0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
        0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
        R R R R S S S S R R
        0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
        0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
    In this figure, the R stands for a rail tile, and the S is part of the 
    station prefab. Who knows how long the rail should be but aparently 
    regional trains are around 40m long minimum
