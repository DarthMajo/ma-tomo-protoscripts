The goal with this directory is to make a dungeon/lair generator.

The generation of such a lair shall be done like so:
    We have a starting point. Place a room of random X and Y size.
        The minimum size of a room is 3x3 blocks, since the room also includes
        the walls.

        ---
        -x-
        ---

    Then at a random wall point, it attempts to make a new room.
        - Check in the void if a room size X and Y is possible
            - If not, calculate the maximum X and Y size the room could be
            - Then place the room, and be sure to have the door there
                - The difficult part in this could be that the door is not
                  necessarily the center of the room. It really could be
                  anything.
